# This is an example of a configuration-file for disposing of received data-products. The syntax is
# standard YAML.

# The following parameter specifies the maximum number of file-descriptors that are kept open by the
# "Append", "File", and "Pipe" actions. Keeping a file-descriptor open can be more efficient than
# closing and reopening. The least-recently-used file descriptor will be closed if a new one is
# needed and the current number of open file-descriptors is this value. The default value is 20.
# maxKeepOpen: 20

# The following specifies the actions to be taken for NOAAPort data-products that match the
# associated patterns. The patterns are specified using ECMAScript regular expressions. It is
# assumed that a product's name is a relative pathname that's based on its WMO abbreviated heading.
# For example, a product whose WMO heading would match this regular expression:
#     ^(..) (....) (....) (..)(..)(..)
# is assumed to have a product-name that matches this pattern
#     $1/$2/$3/<yyyy>-<mm>-$4T$5:$6.txt
# Where "<yyyy>" and "<mm>" are the year and origin-1 month, respectively. Similarly, a product
# whose WMO heading would match this regular expression
#     ^(..) (....) (....) (..)(..)(..) (.*)
# is assumed to have a product-name that matches this pattern
#     $1/$2/$3/<yyyy>-<mm>-$4/$5:$6_$7.txt
# For example, the product name corresponding to the WMO abbreviated heading
#     SAUS14 KAWN 241800 RRX
# could be (depending on the year and month)
#     SA/US14/KAWN/2023-07-24/18:00_RRX.txt
